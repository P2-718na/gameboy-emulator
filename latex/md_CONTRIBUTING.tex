Thank you for wanting to contribute to my project! Here is the list of steps you need to take if you want to help\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Fork my repository to your Git\+Hub
\item Create a new branch. The name of the branch should be consistent with what you are adding. e.\+g. {\ttfamily feature/audio} {\ttfamily fix/ppu-\/glitching}, ...
\item (Optional) open a draft pull request to discuss changes while you are working on them.
\item When writing commits, make sure to use an imperative syntax for commit names (see my commits for examples). The rationale behind this is that {\itshape you are telling git what your commit should do to the code}.
\item Once you are done writing your code, rebase your branch on master and open a pull request. The rebase helps a lot with clarity by keeping a linear commit history.
\item Wait for my approval!

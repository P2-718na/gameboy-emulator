# How to contribute
Thank you for wanting to contribute to my project! Here is the list of steps you need to take
if you want to help:

1. Fork my repository to your GitHub
2. Create a new branch. The name of the branch should be consistent with what you are adding. e.g. `feature/audio`
`fix/ppu-glitching`, ...
3. (Optional) open a draft pull request to discuss changes while you are working on them.
4. When writing commits, make sure to use an imperative syntax for commit names (see my commits for examples).
The rationale behind this is that _you are telling git what your commit should do to the code_.
5. Once you are done writing your code, rebase your branch on master and open a pull request. The rebase
helps a lot with clarity by keeping a linear commit history.
6. Wait for my approval!
